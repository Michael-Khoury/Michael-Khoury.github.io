        <p className="date-range"><em>July 2025 â€“ Present</em></p>
        <p>
          Currently building a scalable backend application for real-time fraud detection in financial transactions using Java, Spring Boot and PostgreSQL, structured with Maven. Designed relational data models with entity relationships and implemented ORM mapping. Exposed functionality through layered RESTful APIs and validated endpoints with Postman using JSON payloads. Integrated Apache Spark for batch analytics of large-scale transactions, deployed the system to AWS EC2 with Amazon RDS.

        <h2>PORTFOLIO WEBSITE</h2>
        <p className="date-range"><em>May 2025 â€“ June 2025</em></p>
        <p>
          This very website! Built from scratch as a full-stack application using React.js (with JSX) for the frontend and Node.js/Express.js for the backend. 
          The frontend includes scroll-aware routing, animated text, fade-in-on-scroll effects, mobile-optimized background behavior, and modular components such as a responsive Navbar, Footer, and ScrollToTop.
          The Contact Me form is powered by a live RESTful backend API hosted on Render, which handles POST requests using Nodemailer for secure email delivery. 
          The backend also supports optional MongoDB integration using Mongoose for scalable message persistence. 
          The entire frontend is styled with custom CSS, fully responsive across devices, and deployed via GitHub Pages.
        </p>

        <h2>UNITY TOWER DEFENSE GAME</h2>
        <p className="date-range"><em>January 2025 â€“ April 2025</em></p>
        <p>
          Developed a polished 2D tower defense game in Unity with two teammates as part of a software design course during my fifth of eight academic semesters in my computer engineering degree.
          Features include an endless wave system, diverse enemy types with unique behaviors, and several strategically distinct towers with powerful abilities (e.g., splash damage, burn effects, curses).
          Includes a boss wave, main menu system, and smooth launch flow with multiple completed releases to date.
          Recognized as one of the top 2 projects in the course in the Winter 2025 semester for its functionality, gameplay depth, and clean architecture.  <br /><br />

          Note: This github repository is private to protect ongoing development, with plans to continue improving and potentially market the game. A demo or walkthrough is available upon request.

        <p>
          Self-initiated during a work term to streamline attendance tracking for myself, my supervisor, and future SI Leaders.
          Automated tracking for over 50 students per session using Python with pandas and openpyxl.
          Saved approximately 3â€“4 hours per week by eliminating manual Excel entry, reducing overall admin workload by 80%.
          Enabled dynamic session logging and error-proof Excel output, leading to more consistent and reliable record-keeping across the semester.

        <p className="date-range"><em>June 2024 â€“ August 2024</em></p>
        <p>
          Developed a Python script for integrating data version control (DVC) into machine learning workflows during my part time work as a Machine Learning Software Developer at VAC Lab.
          Achieved reproducible and efficient ML experiments using YAML configurations and MLflow.
          Collaborated with a research team to improve accuracy for medical imaging datasets.  <br /><br />
